When we use fully connected affine layers to process the image, however, we want each datapoint to be represented by a single vector -- it's no longer useful to segregate the different channels, rows, and columns of the data. So, we use a \"flatten\" operation to collapse the `C x H x W` values per representation into a single long vector. The flatten function below first reads in the N, C, H, and W values from a given batch of data, and then returns a \"view\" of that data. \"View\" is analogous to numpy's \"reshape\" method: it reshapes x's dimensions to be N x ??, where ?? is allowed to be anything (in this case, it will be C x H x W, but we don't need to specify that explicitly).

PyTorch Module API (optional)\n","\n","Similarly to our implementations in the previous part of the assignment, barebone PyTorch requires that we track all the parameter tensors by hand. This is fine for small networks with a few tensors, but it would be extremely inconvenient and error-prone to track tens or hundreds of tensors in larger networks.\n","\n","PyTorch provides the `nn.Module` API for you to define arbitrary network architectures, while tracking every learnable parameters for you. In Part II, we implemented SGD ourselves. PyTorch also provides the `torch.optim` package that implements all the common optimizers, such as RMSProp, Adagrad, and Adam. It even supports approximate second-order methods like L-BFGS! You can refer to the [doc](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html) for the exact specifications of each optimizer.\n","\n","To use the Module API, we follow the steps below:\n","\n","1. Subclass `nn.Module`. Give your network class an intuitive name like `TwoLayerFC`. \n","\n","2. In the constructor `__init__()`, define all the layers you need as class attributes. Layer objects like `nn.Linear` and `nn.Conv2d` are themselves `nn.Module` subclasses and contain learnable parameters, so that you don't have to instantiate the raw tensors yourself. `nn.Module` will track these internal parameters for you. Refer to the [doc](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html) to learn more about the dozens of builtin layers. **Warning**: don't forget to call the `super().__init__()` first!\n","\n","3. In the `forward()` method, define the *connectivity* of your network. You should use the attributes defined in `__init__` as function calls that take tensor as input and output the \"transformed\" tensor. Do *not* create any new layers with learnable parameters in `forward()`! All of them must be declared upfront in `__init__`. \n","\n","After you define your Module subclass, you can instantiate it as an object and call it just like the NN forward function in part II.\n","\n","### Module API: Two-Layer Network\n","Here is a concrete example of a 2-layer fully connected network, using the Kaiming normal initialization method for our weights:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":17,"metadata":{"id":"hNdNZS9QaLhE","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1645501346967,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":190,"user":{"displayName":"Yu-Teng Li","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjXebSOLbLt1vFUtA6ERjh32gFFZqxpgYbxo22oY-w=s64","userId":"01509709559423133004"}},"outputId":"539afef8-4931-4bdb-a689-304019bd5c68"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["torch.Size([64, 10])\n"]}],"source":["class TwoLayerFC(nn.Module):\n","    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, num_classes):\n","        super().__init__()\n","        # assign layer objects to class attributes\n","        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)\n","        # nn.init package contains convenient initialization methods\n","        # http://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html#torch-nn-init \n","        nn.init.kaiming_normal_(self.fc1.weight)\n","        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, num_classes)\n","        nn.init.kaiming_normal_(self.fc2.weight)\n","    \n","    def forward(self, x):\n","        # forward always defines connectivity\n","        x = flatten(x)\n","        scores = self.fc2(F.relu(self.fc1(x)))\n","        return scores\n","\n","def test_TwoLayerFC():\n","    input_size = 50\n","    x = torch.zeros((64, input_size), dtype=dtype)  # minibatch size 64, feature dimension 50\n","    model = TwoLayerFC(input_size, 42, 10)\n","    scores = model(x)\n","    print(scores.size())  # you should see [64, 10]\n","test_TwoLayerFC()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"pZslHonqaLhE"},"source":["### Module API: Three-Layer ConvNet\n","Here is a concrete example of a 3-layer ConvNet.

CIFAR-10 open-ended challenge\n","\n","In this section, you can experiment with whatever ConvNet architecture you'd like on CIFAR-10. \n","\n","Now it's your job to experiment with architectures, hyperparameters, loss functions, and optimizers to train a model that achieves **at least 70%** accuracy on the CIFAR-10 **validation** set within 10 epochs. You can use the check_accuracy and train functions from above. You can use either `nn.Module` or `nn.Sequential` API. \n","\n","Describe what you did at the end of this notebook.\n","\n","Here are the official API documentation for each component. One note: what we call in the class \"spatial batch norm\" is called \"BatchNorm2D\" in PyTorch.\n","\n","* Layers in torch.nn package: http://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html\n","* Activations: http://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#non-linear-activations\n","* Loss functions: http://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#loss-functions\n","* Optimizers: http://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html\n","\n","\n","### Things you might try:\n","- **Filter size**: Above we used 5x5; would smaller filters be more efficient?\n","- **Number of filters**: Above we used 32 filters. Do more or fewer do better?\n","- **Pooling vs Strided Convolution**: Do you use max pooling or just stride convolutions?\n","- **Batch normalization**: Try adding spatial batch normalization after convolution layers and vanilla batch normalization after affine layers. Do your networks train faster?\n","- **Network architecture**: The network above has two layers of trainable parameters. Can you do better with a deep network? Good architectures to try include:\n","    - [conv-relu-pool]xN -> [affine]xM -> [softmax or SVM]\n","    - [conv-relu-conv-relu-pool]xN -> [affine]xM -> [softmax or SVM]\n","    - [batchnorm-relu-conv]xN -> [affine]xM -> [softmax or SVM]\n","- **Global Average Pooling**: Instead of flattening and then having multiple affine layers, perform convolutions until your image gets small (7x7 or so) and then perform an average pooling operation to get to a 1x1 image picture (1, 1 , Filter#), which is then reshaped into a (Filter#) vector. This is used in [Google's Inception Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567) (See Table 1 for their architecture).\n","- **Regularization**: Add l2 weight regularization, or perhaps use Dropout.\n","\n","### Tips for training\n","For each network architecture that you try, you should tune the learning rate and other hyperparameters. When doing this there are a couple important things to keep in mind:\n","\n","- If the parameters are working well, you should see improvement within a few hundred iterations\n","- Remember the coarse-to-fine approach for hyperparameter tuning: start by testing a large range of hyperparameters for just a few training iterations to find the combinations of parameters that are working at all.\n","- Once you have found some sets of parameters that seem to work, search more finely around these parameters. You may need to train for more epochs.\n","- You should use the validation set for hyperparameter search, and save your test set for evaluating your architecture on the best parameters as selected by the validation set.\n","\n","### Going above and beyond\n","If you are feeling adventurous there are many other features you can implement to try and improve your performance. You are **not required** to implement any of these, but don't miss the fun if you have time!\n","\n","- Alternative optimizers: you can try Adam, Adagrad, RMSprop, etc.\n","- Alternative activation functions such as leaky ReLU, parametric ReLU, ELU, or MaxOut.\n","- Model ensembles\n","- Data augmentation\n","- New Architectures\n","  - [ResNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) where the input from the previous layer is added to the output.\n","  - [DenseNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993) where inputs into previous layers are concatenated together.\n","  - [This blog has an in-depth overview](https://chatbotslife.com/resnets-highwaynets-and-densenets-oh-my-9bb15918ee32)\n","\n","### Have fun and happy training!
