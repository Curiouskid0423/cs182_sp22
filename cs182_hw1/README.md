In this assignment you will practice writing backpropagation code, and training
Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks. The goals of this assignment
are as follows:

- understand **Neural Networks** and how they are arranged in layered
  architectures
- understand and be able to implement (vectorized) **backpropagation**
- implement various **update rules** used to optimize Neural Networks
- implement **batch normalization** for training deep networks
- implement **dropout** to regularize networks
- effectively **cross-validate** and find the best hyperparameters for Neural
  Network architecture
- understand the architecture of **Convolutional Neural Networks**
- gain an understanding of how a modern deep learning library (PyTorch) works
  and gain practical experience using it to train models.

## Setup
Make sure your machine is set up with the assignment dependencies.

### [Option 1] Install Anaconda and Required Packages
The preferred approach for installing all the assignment dependencies is to use
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), which is a Python distribution
that includes many of the most popular Python packages for science, math,
engineering and data analysis. Once you install Anaconda you can run the following
command inside the homework directory to install the required packages for this homework:

```bash
conda env create -f cs182_hw1.yaml
```

Once you have all the packages installed, run the following command **every time**
to activate the environment when you work on the homework.
```bash
conda activate cs182_hw1
```

### [Option 2] Working on a Virtual Machine
This assignment is provided pre-setup with a VirtualBox image. Installation Instructions:
1. Follow [the instructions here](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch02.html) to install VirtualBox if it is not already installed.
2. [Download the VirtualBox image here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J1oRKQtIa5gMUxpzOrdLL6taQtGA4a3k/view?usp=sharing)
3. Load the VirtualBox image using [the instructions here](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E26217_01/E26796/html/qs-import-vm.html)
4. Start the VM. The username and password are both cs182. Required packages are pre-installed and the cs182_hw1 environment activated by default.
5. Download the assignment code onto the VM yourself.

#### FAQ
**I get an error "AMD-V is disabled in the BIOS" or "Intel-VT is disabled in the BIOS" or similar**

Solution: See [this link](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/13/html/Virtualization_Guide/sect-Virtualization-Troubleshooting-Enabling_Intel_VT_and_AMD_V_virtualization_hardware_extensions_in_BIOS.html)


**The virtual machine won't boot**

Solutions:

- Try increasing the number of allocated CPUs: Under Settings→System→Processor
- Try [increasing the amount of allocated memory:](https://superuser.com/questions/926339/how-to-change-the-ram-allocated-to-an-os-in-virtualbox)

**Download data:**
Once you have the starter code, you will need to download the CIFAR-10 dataset.
Run the following from the `assignment1` directory:

```bash
cd deeplearning/datasets
./get_datasets.sh
```

**Compile the Cython extension:** Convolutional Neural Networks require a very
efficient implementation. We have implemented of the functionality using
[Cython](http://cython.org/); you will need to compile the Cython extension
before you can run the code. From the `deeplearning` directory, run the following
command:

```bash
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

### Start Jupyter Notebook
After you download data, you should start the IPython notebook server
from the homework 1 directory with the following command:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
This opens a brower tab for you to work.

If you are unfamiliar with IPython, you should
read our [IPython tutorial](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/).

## Submitting your work:
Once you are done working run the `collect_submission.sh` script;
this will produce a file called `assignment1.zip`.
Upload this file to Gradescope.
The Gradescope will run an autograder on the files you submit. It is very unlikely but still possible that your implementation might fail to pass some test cases due to randomness.
If you think your code is correct, you can simply rerun the autograder to check check whether it is really due to randomness.

### Q1: Fully-connected Neural Network (35 points)
The IPython notebook `FullyConnectedNets.ipynb` will introduce you to our
modular layer design, and then use those layers to implement fully-connected
networks of arbitrary depth. To optimize these models you will implement several
popular update rules.

### Q2: Batch Normalization (25 points)
In the IPython notebook `BatchNormalization.ipynb` you will implement batch
normalization, and use it to train deep fully-connected networks.

### Q3: Dropout (10 points)
The IPython notebook `Dropout.ipynb` will help you implement Dropout and explore
its effects on model generalization.

### Q4: ConvNet (20 points)
In the IPython Notebook `ConvolutionalNetworks.ipynb` you will implement several
new layers that are commonly used in convolutional networks as well as implement
a small convolutional network.

### Q5: Train a model on CIFAR10 using Pytorch! (10 points)
Now that you've implemented and gained an understanding for many key components
of a basic deep learning library, it is time to move on to a modern deep learning
library: Pytorch. Here, we will walk you through the key concepts of PyTorch, and
you will use it to experiment and train a model on CIFAR10.

If you would like to access GPUs for faster training, we recommend
you use Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/). If you use Colab for this notebook, make sure to manually download the completed
notebook and place it in the assignment directory before submitting. Also remember
to download required output file and place it into submission_logs/ directory.
